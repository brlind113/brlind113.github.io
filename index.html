Pitch 1
For cooks 
who need to update recipes for number of servings
the serving calculator
reference calculator
that allows users to adjust recipes based on number of servings needed
Unlike trying to use a pencil and paper to figure out the multiplication or division of ingredients
our product lets the cooks configure recipes to what is needed.

Pitch 2
For everyone
who needs to make conversion calculations
the Conversionator
calculator
that can benefit everyone who needs to convert cups to quarts, voltage to amperes, kilograms to pounds, or kilometers to miles.
Unlike having to find the formulas on different various sites
our product does it all in one place.

Pitch 3
For families
who need a common place to share photos
the photo library
storage/database
that takes upload images to share with a selected group
Unlike a private storage database or a family member holding on to single photo
our product allows users to add images and family documents to the database and access is granted by family admins.
